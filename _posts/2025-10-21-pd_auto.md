- POWGEN autoreduction now will write out the XML configuration file that can be loaded into the POWGEN reduction GUI in Mantid Workbench.

- The autoreduction scripts for NOMAD (`all_nom`) and POWGEN (`all_pg3`) now takes an optional argument to specify the output directory. 

- The POWGEN autoreduction configuration backup files are not all organized into a dedicated subfolder under `<IPTS>/shared/autoreduce/auto_params_backup`, where `<IPTS>` refers to the path to the IPTS, e.g., `/SNS/PG3/IPTS-32378`.

- POWGEN autoreduction routine now is able to take the container scale factor as an input parameter to deal with some cases where over- or under-subtraction of the container background is happening.
