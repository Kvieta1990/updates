We have several updates on the data processing and analysis for powder diffraction.

- A batch way of data merging as one of the post-processing steps for running `MantidTotalScattering` reduction is added into the `mts_data` tool. See the documentation [here](https://powder.ornl.gov/data_tools/general.html#mts-data) (specifically, refer to the `-g` flag).

- Run `RMCProfile` in `GSAS-II`. See details [here](https://github.com/Kvieta1990/Kvieta1990/issues/68).
